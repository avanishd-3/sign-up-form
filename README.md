Sign-up-form template with international telephone support.

Written with Vanilla CSS and Typescript.

To modify the logic, edit the TS file (compiles to JS)

Notes:

International telephone support is provided using the [int-tel-input plugin](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input)

I'm currently using Cloudfare as a CDN to access this plugin. I may try bundling in the future, but Webpack creates way too many dependencies for this simple project.

Or, I'll deploy on Netlify.
